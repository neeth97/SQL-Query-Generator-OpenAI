## NOTE:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines vector‐based retrieval with generative models, making it powerful for unstructured data and knowledge‐intensive tasks. However, CSV files are structured tabular data that benefit more from direct, deterministic queries via SQL or DataFrame operations. RAG’s reliance on embeddings can introduce imprecision, missing exact matches or numerical accuracy. Generative responses may hallucinate values or misinterpret schema nuances. Moreover, setting up vector indices for every CSV adds complexity and overhead. Traditional tools like pandas or SQL engines offer efficient, accurate, transparent query mechanisms with well‐defined semantics. In contrast, **RAG’s probabilistic nature undermines reliability and precision for CSV querying.**
